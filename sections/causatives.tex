Ampari has three productive causative derivation suffixes \emph{-tV}/\emph{-dV}/\emph{-ntV}/\emph{-ndV}, \emph {-gV} and \emph {-mV} typical for most Dogon languages. Their distribution is lexically defined, though the input stems in each case do share common semantic features. Among the three, causative in \emph {-mV} is the most productive one. Morphotactically, \emph {-tV} and \emph {-gV} occupy the same linear position as the reversive (\emph{-rV}) and the inchoative (\emph {-yV}), while \emph {-mV} can be combined with those suffixes.

\section{Causatives in  \emph{-tV}/\emph{-dV}/\emph{-ntV}/\emph{-ndV}}\label{causT}
Sinchronically, the choice between 4 causative allomorphs (\emph{-tV}, \emph{-dV}, \emph{-ntV} and \emph{-ndV}) appears be unexplained by any synchronic phonotactic rule. These causatives are typical for inchoative-causative pairs discussed in Subsection \ref{subsection:inch_caus_sec}. Cf. examples (\getref{inchtr002} -- \getref{inchtr030}).
